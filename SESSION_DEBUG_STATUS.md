# Session Security Investigation Status

## Current Issue
Login functionality broken after enabling secure cookies in production.

## Investigation Summary

### Root Cause Identified
- **2-level proxy setup**: `nginx (HTTPS) → Dokku nginx (HTTP) → Express app`
- **Header overwriting**: Dokku nginx overwrites `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` with `X-Forwarded-Proto: http`
- **Express behavior**: Express refuses to set secure cookies when `req.secure` is false

### Key Findings
1. External traffic correctly uses HTTPS via `www.worlddriven.org`
2. Main nginx properly sets `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`
3. Dokku nginx config overwrites this header with `$scheme` (which is `http`)
4. Express sees `req.secure = false` and `req.protocol = 'http'`

### Debug Evidence
```
Headers debug - X-Forwarded-Proto: http X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.178.64 Host: worlddriven-webapp.tooangel.org
Trust proxy setting: 2
Session debug - ID: OTKjNCsh3nDWrgoIZ-FaYtDXFyWOC4Ry User ID: 68b9cc583268aebdcfc0cc3f Secure: false Protocol: http
```

### Attempted Solutions
1. ✅ **Fixed main nginx config**: Changed `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;` to `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;`
2. ❌ **Force secure cookies**: Enabled `sess.cookie.secure = true` despite Express thinking connection is HTTP
3. **Result**: Login broke - sessions not working

## Theory vs Reality
- **Theory**: Browser should respect secure flag since it's making HTTPS requests
- **Reality**: Something is preventing session functionality entirely

## Current State
- **Code changes**: 
  - Secure cookies enabled in production (`sess.cookie.secure = true`)
  - Debug logging removed
  - Proper documentation added
- **Status**: Login broken - sessions not being created/maintained
- **Deployed**: Changes pushed to production but functionality broken

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Investigate why login completely broke
   - Check if sessions are being created at all
   - Verify cookie settings in browser dev tools
   - Consider if Express is rejecting session creation entirely
   
2. **Alternative approaches**:
   - **Option A**: Fix Dokku nginx to preserve `X-Forwarded-Proto` header
     ```bash
     dokku nginx:set worlddriven-webapp x-forwarded-proto-value '$http_x_forwarded_proto'
     ```
   - **Option B**: Revert to non-secure cookies with proper documentation
   - **Option C**: Override Express session middleware behavior

3. **Investigation**: 
   - Add temporary debug logging back to understand what's happening
   - Check if issue is with cookie creation or cookie transmission
   - Test with different session configuration options

## Files Modified
- `src/index.js`: Enabled secure cookies, added documentation, removed debug logs
- `package.json`: Sorted by tooling

## Configuration Details
- **Trust proxy**: Set to `2` (handles 2-level proxy)
- **Secure cookies**: Currently enabled but breaking functionality  
- **Session store**: MongoDB via connect-mongo
- **External access**: HTTPS only via www.worlddriven.org (redirects working)

## Debug Commands
```bash
# Check session cookie in browser dev tools
# Monitor app logs: ssh vogt "dokku logs worlddriven-webapp --tail"
# Test external access: curl -v https://www.worlddriven.org/
```
