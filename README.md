World driven introduces a contribution based weighted voting system
for time-based auto-merges. It defines a process and automates the process of
merging Pull Requests based on Reviews.

World driven automatically merges Pull Requests after a certain amount of time,
this gives interested people time to review and approve or request changes (in
world driven speech: vote).
Positive votes reduce the time to merge to speed up the release. Previous
contributions are the factor of this merge boost (think of number of commits).
Voting against the Pull Request increases the time to merge. Reaching a certain
threshold blocks the merge.

The configuration for the repository is:

- Merge duration for a pull request: 10 days
- Per commit time: 0 days
- Merge method: squash

## Issue Labels

We use a comprehensive labeling system to organize issues and pull requests:

### Issue Types
- **bug** - Something isn't working correctly
- **enhancement** - New feature or improvement to existing functionality  
- **question** - Requires further information or discussion

### Issue Status
- **duplicate** - This issue or pull request already exists
- **invalid** - This doesn't seem right or is not actionable
- **wontfix** - We will not work on or change this
- **WIP** - Work in progress - do not merge yet

### Community
- **help wanted** - Community contributions welcome
- **good first issue** - Good for newcomers - straightforward task for first-time contributors
- **discussion** - Needs discussion or decision before implementation

### Technical Categories
- **dependencies** - Pull requests that update a dependency file
- **javascript** - JavaScript code changes or improvements
- **infrastructure** - Infrastructure, deployment, and DevOps tasks
- **security** - Security-related issues and vulnerabilities
- **modernization** - Modernizing code and dependencies
- **technical-debt** - Code cleanup and refactoring tasks
- **monitoring** - Monitoring, logging, and observability

## Setup

### Run with docker compose
Copy `.env-example` to `.env` and add your environment variables.
```sh
docker compose up
```

### Manual

The application uses MongoDB as back end, the default configuration is `localhost:27017`
This can be overwritten with the environment variable: `MONGODB_URI`

Gunicorn serves as the server, checkout the `Procfile` or use
`gunicorn --workers=1 --worker-class=flask_sockets.worker server:app --chdir src`.

The authentication and authorization uses GitHub OAuth and API.

For OAuth and merging of pull requests create an GitHub OAuth App
(https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app)
and set `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` as environment variable.
The GitHub callback path is: `/github-callback`.

For commenting create and set a personal token
(https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
as: `GITHUB_USER_TOKEN`

Set Session secret as `SESSION_SECRET` initial a random string.

To disable https in a local environment set `DEBUG=true` as environment variable.

#### Prepare PostgreSQL server

```
sudo -u postgres psql
postgres=# create database mydb;
postgres=# create user myuser with encrypted password 'mypass';
postgres=# grant all privileges on database mydb to myuser;
```

## Testing

Run JavaScript tests with: `npm run test`
Run python tests with: `pytest`

## Configuration

To allow different configurations on different repositories you can place a
`.worlddriven.ini` (see `.worlddriven.ini-example`) in the root of your
repository and adapt the values.
When World Driven checks new Pull Requests it fetches the `.worlddriven.ini` from
your default branch (fetching from the Pull Request could be a security issue)
and applies the configuration.

## Front end

The Front end has three views:

- `/` the front page
- `/dashboard` a dashboard with an overview of the repositories and a button to
enable World Driven for the repository
- `/:org/:repo/pull/:pull_number` A detailed calculation breakdown for the pull
request

Use the following endpoints to more easily work on the dashboard with mock data:

- `/test/dashboard` - for the dashboard
- `/test/:org/:repo/pull/:pull_number` - for the pull request view

## Production environment

The World Driven auto-merge service is:

- hosted on Heroku
- tested via CircleCI,
- merged via World Driven and automatically deployed.
