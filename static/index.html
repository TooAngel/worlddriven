      <h2>Phase One: Dynamic Code Ownership</h2>

      <h3>The Challenge</h3>

      <p>
        For decades, open source projects have brought transparency and openness
        to development. Over time, certain problems have come to light:
      </p>

      <ul class="challenge-bullets">
        <li>
          <h4>Contribution can be frustrating due to unclear processes</h4>
          For example, I had a couple of cases where contributions / Pull
          Requests were missing communication or agreement on when to merge
          between the maintainers or were just ignored.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>The power of progress is restricted to a certain group</h4>
          Independent of previous contributions, the direction of a project is
          decided upon by a limited number of people or companies with possibly
          hidden agendas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Projects die even with interested contributors</h4>
          The owner of the project is not interested any more or has become
          sidetracked and so no longer manages any contributions
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Project owner change leads to uncertainties</h4>
          One of the bad examples:
          <a
            href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/11/26/npm_repo_bitcoin_stealer/"
            >The event-stream incident</a
          >
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>An Idea</h3>

      <p>
        Establish a contribution-based, weighted voting system for time-based
        auto-merges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nice sentence, but what does that mean? In the following, I'm using the
        GitHub vocabulary but I hope this can be easily translated into similar
        systems:
      </p>
      <p>
        Contributions are presented as Pull Requests, the Pull Requests are
        automatically merged after a certain time by the world driven
        auto-merger. Contributors have the possibility to vote on the merge by
        reviewing the Pull Request and either Approving (for) or Requesting
        Changes (against). The weight of the vote depends on their previous
        contributions: The more contributions the reviewer has made the more
        their vote can speed up or slow down the merge date.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a certain threshold of negative points is reached, the merge is
        cancelled.
      </p>

      <h4>An Example</h4>
      <p>
        For different projects a different configuration than the one given here
        may make more sense, but this example will help explain the process
        regardless of the specific configuration chosen:
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's say that the merge duration is 10 days long, the weight is the
        number of commits on the repository and the project itself has 1000 of
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alice sends her first Pull Request to this project. Bob, one of the
        active contributors who has 400 commits, likes the changes and votes to
        'Approve' them in his review. As a result, the time until the auto-merge
        completes is reduced by 4 days: 400 (contributions from Bob) / 1000
        (overall commits in the project) * 10 (the merge duration).
      </p>

      <p>
        Carol, who is fairly new to the project but already has 100 commits,
        doesn't like the styling and wants the code refactored into methods. Her
        'Request Changes' review increases the time to merge by one day: 100
        (contributions from Carol) / 1000 (overall commits in the project) * 10
        (the initial merge duration).
      </p>

      <p>
        Alice agrees to Carol's suggestions, prepares the changes and pushes
        them so the timer is reset due to code changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bob agrees to this altered version of the Pull Request (-4 days) as does
        Carol (-1 day). So, overall this Pull Request now has 5 days until it is
        merged.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next time Alice, due to her now merged contributions, has the ability to
        vote on any future Pull Requests. This means she can have some
        responsibility over the progress of the project.
      </p>

      <p>Of course, if 100% vote for a Pull Request it is merged directly.</p>

      <h4>Current Status</h4>
      <p>
        The auto-merger is working on itself and a couple of other projects as
        well; therefore, I would say it is in a prototype state.
      </p>

      <p>
        A status check is used to show the current time until the Pull Request
        is merged and provide a link to a detailed breakdown of how that time
        has been calculated.
      </p>
      <div class="status-check">
        <picture>
          <source media="(min-width: 801px)" srcset="images/merge_at_big.png" />
          <source
            media="(min-width: 526px) and (max-width: 800px)"
            srcset="images/merge_at_med.png"
          />
          <source
            media="(max-width: 525px)"
            srcset="images/merge_at_small.png"
          />
          <img src="images/merge_at_med.png" />
        </picture>
      </div>

      <h4>Why?:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Due to the clear rules, it is easy to see what happens with your PR
          and when it will be merged.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some open source projects struggle with their maintainer. This way
          others can still drive the project forward in their absence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Weighting the votes gives the main contributors the most power to
          either stall/block bad PRs or to speed good ones up. In addition, it
          can motivate people to contribute more to the project in order to
          increase their own weight.
        </li>
        <li>
          One fundamental question is how this system interacts with the idea of
          a repository having an owner? Currently, the owner of the project has
          full control and can stop or speed up anything they wish. It would be
          nice if they didn't have to.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There are definitely ways this system can be tricked with certain types
        of behaviour but that's not the idea behind using world driven. Working
        on an open source project is all about collaboration so most, if not
        all, of this unwanted behaviour can easily be solved by communication.
      </p>

      <h4>Current Rules:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          10 days (at least more than a week) should give everyone enough time
          to look into the Pull Request.
        </li>
        <li>
          The time is increased for each commit in the Pull Request. This is
          because multiple commits indicate a certain degree of complexity
          behind the request hence reviewers will need more time to check it.
        </li>
        <li>
          GitHub's reviewing functionality is the perfect place to discuss the
          PR and express your preference (GitLab is the same but that feature is
          not yet implemented).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="future-phases">
        <h2>Phase Two: Transparent Services</h2>
        <p>
          Having clear and automated rules for progressing in open source
          projects is just the start. Due to the DevOps (or GitOps) ideas, many
          operational tasks are now stored in repositories and applied upon
          merge. So the challenge now is building (world driven) services that
          operate on these ideas and are only maintained via Pull Requests. This
          provides a new level of trust and a new entity
          <em>unavailable system data</em> (still searching for a better name).
          Passwords, service credentials and the like is data which does not
          necessarily have to be accessible by humans; it can therefore be
          maintained and used exclusively in the system itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example: In one of the companies I was working for, the employees
          were using Chromeboxes. As part of their daily work they had to split
          and merge PDFs. There are a lot of (free) services out there that can
          do the job but they can't be used due to privacy concerns - What
          happens with my PDFs? Do they store them? Do they use them? - I hope
          (and guess) that they don't but I can't be sure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Compare that to a PDF service that is open source, world driven and
          uses continuous deployment. No one has access to any credentials and
          changes can only be done via public Pull Requests - That sounds far
          more transparent to me.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="future-phases-2">
        <h2>Phase Three: Down the Rabbit Hole</h2>
        <p>In my mind these examples use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Some CI services for testing and deployment</li>
          <li>Some automated hosting environment (PaaS)</li>
          <li>Some databases...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The web service itself is World Driven but can I trust the other
          parties? Why not build the infrastructure in the same way? Using IaaS
          instead of higher level managed server is a lot to do but it is doable
          (I know, I've already built a PaaS). In my opinion, a World Driven,
          fully automated IaaS is more challenging.
        </p>
